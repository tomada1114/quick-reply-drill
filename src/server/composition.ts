 * The one line in this repository that decides which vendor answers.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The fake adapter is what makes `pnpm dev` and `POST /api/ask` work with
 * nothing configured, and it is what this file still wires. `createOpenAiLlmPort`
 * is shipped alongside it and deliberately not wired yet — choosing the model
 * and the reasoning effort per call site is its own change. A provider
 * adapter is swapped in here and nowhere else — no environment variable
 * selects between them at runtime, because that would move the choice out of
 * the file whose whole job is to hold it. Wiring one built over
 * `env.OPENAI_API_KEY` is the same one-line edit in the other direction.
