 * `POST /api/ask`: `readServerEnv` requires `API_ACCESS_KEY` while it is
 * `true`, so a deployment that pays for its answers cannot boot with the
 * endpoint open. A machine that exports `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for an unrelated
 * reason still bills nothing while the fake adapter answers, which is why the
 * gate cannot be keyed off that variable's presence.
 *
 * It sits above the environment read because the read has to happen before an
 * adapter can be handed a credential. Flipping it is the other half of the
 * adapter swap below: an adapter changed without it is a paid model call left
 * open to whoever finds the URL.
