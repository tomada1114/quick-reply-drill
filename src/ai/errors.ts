 * prompt, or a model's output, because any of those can carry request content
 * back out through a log line. The original failure, when there was one, is
 * kept on `cause` instead (by identity when it was already an `Error` — see
 * {@link asError}), so a log can still show it without any caller having to
 * know the provider's error classes.

 * because a caller is not obliged to pass a signal at all and `LlmPort.generate`
 * promises to settle regardless — so an adapter composes a bound of its own over
 * whatever transport it owns. What this function does is narrower than either:
 * it translates whatever the abort carried into the one error vocabulary above
 * without losing the reason's identity — see {@link asError} — so which deadline
 * fired, the caller's or the adapter's, is readable on `cause`.
