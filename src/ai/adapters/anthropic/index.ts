/**
 * Builds an {@link LlmPort} backed by the Anthropic Messages API.

 * @remarks
 * The answer is validated twice, against two different things, and both are
 * load-bearing. The API validates it against the JSON Schema derived from
 * `schema`; this function then validates it again against `schema` itself, with
 * `safeParseAsync`. The second pass is not redundant, because the conversion to
 * JSON Schema silently drops what JSON Schema cannot say — a `refine`, a
 * branded type — so a response the API accepted can still fail the contract the
 * caller actually wrote. What it does *not* do is drop everything: a construct
 * with no JSON Schema equivalent at all (`transform`, `pipe`, `z.date`) makes
 * the conversion throw instead, which is why building the request is its own
 * guarded step below.
 *
 * `messages.create` is what that second pass requires. `messages.parse` would
 * apply `zodOutputFormat`'s own parser, which is Zod's *synchronous* `safeParse`
 * and therefore throws outright on a schema carrying an async refinement — the
 * one thing `LlmPort` promises never to do for an expected failure. The SDK
 * documents `create` as the call that returns the answer unparsed for exactly
 * this purpose.
