 * prompt: a rejected one is re-prompted, not retried and not reconfigured.
 * Everything unrecognised falls to `ERR_LLM_UNAVAILABLE`, which is the code

 * as the raw `AbortError` the platform threw, which is an ordinary

 * Translates whatever the SDK threw into the one error vocabulary the port
 * publishes.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `signal` is the one the request was made under — the adapter's own deadline
 * composed with the caller's signal when there was one — and never the SDK's
 * internal controller, which aborts with no reason at all. The SDK reports an
 * abort as its `APIUserAbortError`, which carries a message of its own and not
 * the reason that ended the request; rebuilding the error from the signal is
 * what lets a caller compare `result.error.cause` against the reason it
 * supplied, by identity, and what carries a fired deadline's own
 * `TimeoutError` through unchanged. See {@link abortedLlmError}. Required
 * rather than optional for that reason: a caller with no signal to hand over
 * would silently lose the identity this exists to keep.
 *
 * Order matters twice. `APIConnectionTimeoutError` and `APIUserAbortError` are
 * both `APIError` subclasses, so the general HTTP case has to come last; and
 * the timeout check has to precede {@link isAbortError}, because the SDK builds
 * its deadline out of an abort and only it can tell that one apart from the
 * caller's.
