/**

 *
 * @remarks
 * Wall clock over the entire call — every attempt and the body read — where
 * `timeoutMs` is per attempt and reaches only as far as the headers. A
 * provider that answers `200` and then dribbles bytes is the case it exists
 * for: nothing else settles that request, because the caller's `AbortSignal`
 * is optional and the SDK's own timer has already been cleared.
 *
 * Derived rather than fixed, because a fixed constant computed from the
 * *default* `timeoutMs` and `maxRetries` silently under-cuts a caller who
 * configures either: `createAnthropicAdapter({ apiKey, timeoutMs: 300_000 })`
 * implies a single attempt can take five minutes, but a fixed `130_000` total
 * bound would abort before even that first attempt's own header timeout could
 * fire. Deriving from the resolved values instead means the two options stay
 * true to what they say they bound.
 *
 * Three terms:
 *
 * - `(maxRetries + 1) * timeoutMs` — every attempt, each of which may spend
 *   its whole `timeoutMs` waiting for response *headers*.
 * - `maxRetries * BACKOFF_CEILING_MS` — the backoff sleep between attempts,
 *   each bounded by the SDK's own ceiling on its *computed* backoff
 *   (`@anthropic-ai/sdk@^0.122.0`). A provider-supplied `retry-after` is the
 *   other thing that sleep can be, and it fits the same term only because
 *   {@link declineLongRetryAfter} declines one longer than
 *   `MAX_RETRY_AFTER_MS`, which is that ceiling's own value. Every sleep
 *   here is therefore at most 8 s whatever chose its length.
 * - `BODY_READ_MARGIN_MS` — exactly one body read, which happens once, behind
 *   the headers that finally arrive, and is the stretch `timeoutMs` cannot
 *   reach.
 *
 * With the shipped defaults (`DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS`, `DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES`) this
 * comes to `2 * 60_000 + 1 * 8_000 + 2_000 = 130_000` — the same number this
 * used to be a fixed constant, so an application that configures neither
 * option sees no change at all.
 *
 * An explicit `deadlineMs` skips this function entirely and is honoured even
 * when it is shorter than one attempt's `timeoutMs`, because shortest-wins is
 * what composing a deadline into an `AbortSignal` means: a caller asking for a
 * hard five-second total bound while leaving a sixty-second per-attempt
 * timeout is asking for exactly the right thing. What it does not buy is
 * punctuality: a deadline that fires while any backoff sleep is in flight is
 * noticed only when that sleep ends, because `retryRequest` awaits it without
 * consulting the signal. The worst case is therefore
 * `deadlineMs + MAX_RETRY_AFTER_MS` — 138 s at the shipped defaults — and the
 * addend is now a sleep this repository chose to afford rather than one the
 * provider chose for it. The derived budget above already allows for every
 * sleep, so it is a short *explicit* `deadlineMs` that actually spends the
 * overshoot.
