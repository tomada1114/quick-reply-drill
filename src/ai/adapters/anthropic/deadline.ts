/**
 * Rejects `timeoutMs` and `maxRetries` on their own terms, before either feeds
 * the deadline derivation.
 *
 * @remarks
 * An explicit `deadlineMs` skips {@link defaultDeadlineMs} entirely — #65's
 * design, which {@link resolveDeadlineMs}'s own remarks describe — so that path
 * is the *only* place these two options are looked at on their own. Without
 * this check, `{ maxRetries: -1, deadlineMs: 60_000 }` constructs cleanly and
 * reaches `new Anthropic({ maxRetries: -1 })`, where the SDK's
 * `retriesRemaining > 0` is never true and retries are silently off.
 *
 * This is deliberately not a cross-check against `deadlineMs`: an individually
 * valid `timeoutMs`/`maxRetries` pair that derives to something unarmable is
 * still the derived-deadline check's job below, not this one's.
 *
 * `timeoutMs` shares {@link MAX_DEADLINE_MS} as its own ceiling: a per-attempt
 * timeout larger than the largest total bound the platform can ever arm could
 * never be reached anyway. `maxRetries` has no ceiling beyond being a
 * non-negative integer — `0` is valid and already relied on by this module's
 * own tests; this issue asks only that the option be checked, not that a retry
 * policy be invented.
 *
 * @throws A `RangeError` naming whichever option the caller passed.

/**
 * The total deadline one adapter runs its requests under.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Resolved once, at construction, and validated there rather than left for
 * {@link requestSignal} to discover per request. Checking against
 * {@link MAX_DEADLINE_MS} — Node's *signed* 32-bit timer ceiling — catches two
 * different platform failures at once: a delay genuinely outside
 * `AbortSignal.timeout`'s own unsigned 32-bit range (a negative, a fraction,
 * `Infinity`) throws a `RangeError` there and then, while a delay merely above
 * the signed ceiling does not throw at all — Node silently clamps it and the
 * signal fires within a millisecond instead of after the duration requested.
 * The first would surface as a *rejected* `generate()`, the one thing
 * `LlmPort` promises never happens; the second would surface as no error at
 * all, just an answer that arrives at completely the wrong time. A deadline
 * out of range is a composition-root mistake, and a start-up failure is where
 * that points.
 *
 * `timeoutMs` and `maxRetries` are checked on their own terms first, via
 * {@link validateAttemptOptions} — see its remarks for why that cannot simply be
 * folded into the check below. What follows here catches the other case: a
 * `deadlineMs`, explicit or derived, that is itself out of range.
 *
 * `explicit` wins outright when it is given, even when it is shorter than one
 * attempt's `timeoutMs`: shortest-wins is what composing a deadline into an
 * `AbortSignal` means, and a caller asking for a hard bound below its
 * per-attempt timeout is asking for exactly the right thing. The two messages
 * differ for the same reason — only one of these is a value the caller typed.
 *
 * @throws A `RangeError` naming whichever option the caller can act on.

/**
 * The signal one request is actually made under.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Composed, not raced. A `Promise.race` against a timer settles the promise the
 * adapter returns while leaving the socket open and the body still arriving,
 * which bounds the caller's wait and nothing else; aborting the transport is
 * what ends the request. Composing also makes the bound *total* rather than per
 * attempt — an abort landing between retries ends the chain instead of starting
 * another attempt, so `maxRetries` no longer multiplies it. Ends it, but not
 * necessarily on time: the SDK's backoff sleep does not consult the signal, so
 * an abort arriving mid-sleep is noticed only when the next attempt begins. The
 * overshoot that costs is bounded rather than open-ended — at most
 * `MAX_RETRY_AFTER_MS`, because no sleep the SDK starts can outlast it once
 * `declineLongRetryAfter` refuses a longer `retry-after`. See
 * {@link defaultDeadlineMs} for the arithmetic.
 *
 * `AbortSignal.any` propagates the *first* aborting source's `reason`, which is
 * what keeps the error identity the port promises: a caller that aborted with
 * its own error still finds that instance on `cause`, and a fired deadline
 * arrives as `AbortSignal.timeout`'s own `TimeoutError`. Both are
 * `ERR_LLM_TIMEOUT` — the code whose remedy, give up on this request, is right
 * either way.
 *
 * `AbortSignal.timeout`'s timer is unref'd, so an armed deadline never holds
 * the process — or a test run — open past the request it bounds. It is also not
 * cancellable, which is what a caller has to know before arming one: this is
 * called per request, once the call is certain to be sent.
