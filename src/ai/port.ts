 * One structured-output request to a language model.

 * @remarks
 * `schema` is what makes the call structured: the adapter asks the model for
 * data shaped like it and validates the answer against it, so a caller never
 * parses prose. `outputLanguage` is a BCP 47 tag naming the language the model
 * should write its *content* in — it does not change the shape `schema`
 * describes.
 *
 * Nothing here names a provider, a model id, or a token budget. Those are an
 * adapter's own construction-time configuration, not part of a request, which
 * is what lets the same request run against a fake, a recording, and a live
 * provider unchanged.

 *

 * sends its headers and then stalls cannot leave the promise pending forever,
 * is the implementation's obligation and not its caller's — `signal` above is

   * A successful parse does not end a deadline's authority over the call.
   * `schema` validation runs with `safeParseAsync`, so a schema carrying an

   * already arrived — and `signal`, or whatever bound an adapter composes over
   * it, can fire while that validation is still running. An implementation
   * re-checks the signal once validation resolves and reports `ERR_LLM_TIMEOUT`
   * rather than the parsed value when it fired, even though the parse itself
   * succeeded: the deadline bounds the whole call, and validation is part of
   * it, not a step that happens after the call is already over.
