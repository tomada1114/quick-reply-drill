 * Locale detection, at the edge of every page request.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`; this is that file, and
 * `next-intl`'s middleware factory is what fills it. It sits inside `src/`
 * rather than at the repository root because that is where Next.js looks for
 * it in a project whose App Router tree is `src/app/` — at the root it is
 * simply never loaded, and every unprefixed path 404s with the build still
 * green. It reads the request's
 * `Accept-Language` header and its locale cookie, then redirects a path with no
 * locale prefix — `/` above all — to one that has it.

/**
 * The paths locale detection runs on.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Everything except API routes, the framework's own asset trees, and any path
 * with a file extension: none of those is a page, so prefixing one with a
 * locale would only break it. Each excluded name is anchored to a whole path
 * segment — followed by `/` or the end of the path — so it excludes `api` and
 * `api/...` without also excluding `apiary` or `api-docs`, which are ordinary
 * page paths that need a locale prefix like any other. This pattern and the
 * `[locale]` segment have to agree — a page path the proxy skips never gets a
 * prefix and 404s against the segment, with nothing else in the tree noticing
 * — so `tests/proxy.test.ts` asserts both halves.
