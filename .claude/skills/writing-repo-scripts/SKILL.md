  Use when writing or editing a .mjs under scripts/** or scripts/lib/**, or when
  repository automation misbehaves under a git hook: an inherited GIT_DIR or
  GIT_INDEX_FILE making a spawned git write to the wrong repository despite a cwd or -C
  (isolatedGitEnv), a lefthook pre-commit failure, importing anything outside node:*
  builtins, JSDoc boundary types under allowJs/checkJs, narrowing JSON.parse through
  scripts/lib/json.mjs, the import.meta.main CLI guard, or how a script must report
  failure on stderr with an ERR_<STAGE>_* code.

# Writing Repository Scripts

**Owns:** the authoring contract for `scripts/**/*.mjs` — imports, typing, git safety,
and the stderr contract. **Does not own:** authoring a skill or mirroring it into
`.claude/skills/` (`authoring-skills`); where a script's tests live and its coverage
floor (`placing-tests`); the `ERR_<STAGE>_*` code vocabulary shared with `src/`
(`designing-errors`).

## Why `.mjs`, not `.ts`

- `scripts/**` must run on a plain Node **before** `pnpm install` has been run, so it
  cannot depend on a compile step or on anything installed. Author it as `.mjs`.
- Import only `node:*` builtins and the shared helpers under `scripts/lib/`. Never
  import a dependency from `node_modules` directly — a script that needs an installed
  tool spawns it at run time instead, so the script still loads even when that
  dependency is absent. No script does today, and no helper resolves a dependency's bin
  any more, so a script that needs one has to locate it and hand the path to `runNode`
  (`scripts/lib/node-tools.mjs`) itself.
- Import Node globals explicitly (`import process from "node:process"`,
  `import console from "node:console"`) rather than relying on the ambient globals Node
  provides at the top level.

## Typing under `allowJs`/`checkJs`

Enforced by: `tsconfig.json`'s `allowJs`/`checkJs` and the `scripts` include entry; the
automation/node-scripts block in `eslint.config.mjs`.

- These files are type-checked exactly like a `.ts` module. Declare boundary types in
  JSDoc (`@param`, `@returns`, `@typedef`) with the same rigor as a TypeScript signature
  — an untyped parameter here is as much a gap as one in `src/`.
- Receive `JSON.parse` output as `unknown` and narrow it through `readKey`/`readString`
  in `scripts/lib/json.mjs`, never a direct cast. `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`
  and the typed-lint `dot-notation` rule disagree about literal-key access on a
  `Record`, so reads go through these helpers instead of picking one style and tripping
  the other.

```js
import { parseJson, readString } from "./lib/json.mjs";

const manifest = parseJson(readFileSync(manifestPath, "utf8"));
const name = readString(manifest, "name");
```

## The CLI guard

A file that is both importable (from a test) and runnable as a command guards its CLI
half with Node's own `import.meta.main`, so importing it for a test never triggers a
run.

```js
if (import.meta.main) {
  await main(process.argv.slice(2));
}
```

The property is true only for the module Node was started with, and Node resolves that
entry through symlinks — a script reached through a `node_modules/.bin` shim still
reports true, while a module the entry merely imports reports false, and so does every
script a test imports. `import.meta.url.endsWith("foo.mjs")` is true in both cases and
cannot make that distinction, so do not reach for it. Neither wrap the property in a
shared helper: a helper can only ever see the `import.meta.url` its caller hands it,
never its caller's `import.meta.main`, so it buys indirection and no reach.
`@types/node` declares `main` on `ImportMeta`, so `checkJs` accepts the property and a
mistyped one still fails as `TS2339`.

## Spawning `git`

Git exports `GIT_DIR` to every hook it runs, and `git commit -- <path>` also exports a
temporary `GIT_INDEX_FILE`; `lefthook.yml` runs this suite from its own pre-commit hook.
An inherited `GIT_DIR` **outranks** both a `cwd` and an explicit `-C` — a `git` spawned
with only a `cwd` writes to the outer repository's index and object store, not the one
the caller meant.

Any `git` invocation that names the repository it means must clear `GIT_*` first, with
`isolatedGitEnv` from `scripts/lib/git-env.mjs`:

```js
import { isolatedGitEnv } from "./lib/git-env.mjs";

spawnSync("git", ["init", "-q"], { cwd: fixtureDir, env: isolatedGitEnv() });
```

The one exception is `scripts/check-staged.mjs`, which **is** the pre-commit layer and
must read the index that hook was given, so it inherits `GIT_*` deliberately. Its own
tests clear the variables from their own process with `vi.stubEnv` instead of routing
through `isolatedGitEnv`.

## The stderr contract

An error raised by automation is read by an agent, not a human watching a terminal, so
it must say: what failed, the path or export involved, expected versus actual, an error
code, and the next safe command to run — and never a secret or an absolute home path.
**REQUIRED:** `designing-errors` for the `ERR_<STAGE>_*` code vocabulary a new script's
errors should join.

Worked example, the report `scripts/sync-agents.mjs` prints when `pnpm agents:check`
finds the mirror out of step with its source:

```
ERR_AGENTS_DRIFT: .claude/skills/ is not a copy of .agents/skills/.
Expected: a byte-identical mirror of .agents/skills/.
Actual:
  differs: .claude/skills/writing-repo-scripts/SKILL.md
Next: run `pnpm agents:sync`.
```

## Coverage

A new script is covered by the `scripts/**` coverage floor from the moment it exists —
an untested file counts as 0%, not as absent from the measurement. **BACKGROUND:**
`placing-tests` explains why `scripts/**` and `scripts/lib/guard/**` carry their own
floors instead of `src/**`'s.
