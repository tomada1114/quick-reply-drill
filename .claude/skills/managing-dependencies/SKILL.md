# Managing Dependencies

**Owns:** whether a package may exist in this repository at all, and what happens at
install time. **Does not own:** landing an existing bot PR (`merge-dependabot`).

This repository is a private application. Nothing here is packed, published, or consumed
as a tarball, so a dependency is judged by what it costs to install and to run — never
by what it would do to a published surface.

## The review record a new runtime dependency needs

Adding a runtime dependency is a permanent supply-chain commitment, so before adding
one, record all of the following in the PR that adds it. Missing one item is not a
detail to fill in later — it means the review has not actually happened yet.

- Why a small hand-written helper or a Node builtin cannot replace it. `node:util`'s
  `parseArgs` covers subcommands (`allowPositionals`) and rejects unknown flags
  (`strict`), so an argument-parser dependency needs a reason beyond convenience.
- Maintainer and release continuity — actively maintained, not abandoned.
- License compatibility. `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` denies a copyleft
  license outright, so a package under one does not merge; find another.
- Direct and transitive package count it pulls in — a large transitive surface is a real
  cost even behind a small direct API.
- Whether it runs an install script, ships a native binary, or does network access —
  each needs its own justification, and an install script also needs a ruling in
  `allowBuilds` (see below).
- Supported Node versions and module format (ESM/CJS) against this repository's own
  `devEngines.runtime` and `"type": "module"` in `package.json`.
- Open security advisories and npm provenance.
- Which of `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, or `optionalDependencies` it belongs in,
  and why. There is no fourth option: this repository publishes nothing, so it declares
  no `peerDependencies` of its own. Every peer range you will meet was declared by
  something you installed.

A runtime entry is the expensive one: `dependencies` is what ships to the running
application and what the weekly `security-audit.yml` job audits with
`pnpm audit --prod`. A build- or test-only package belongs in `devDependencies`, where
an advisory is handled by a bot PR instead of paging whoever reads that schedule.

## Verifying a dependency change before it lands

A manifest and lockfile change is verified by a real install and a real run, never by a
test that mocks a package manager at its subprocess boundary. Run, in order:

```bash
pnpm install            # regenerates pnpm-lock.yaml; must succeed under the policy below
pnpm check:quick        # format, lint, typecheck, tests
pnpm build              # next build — the App Router entry points and the framework's
                        # own build pipeline, which no unit test exercises
pnpm test:coverage      # the coverage floors, which a swapped dependency can move
```

The last three are together what `pnpm check:source` runs, so one green run of that
covers them all. One narrower run is worth naming, because the gate reports its failure
only as a wall of output: the suite for the module that actually consumes the bumped
package, run on its own.

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run tests/<module>.test.ts
```

A `zod` bump surfaces first in whichever contract suite parses with it; a `react` bump
in the component tests. No suite reaches a live service either way:
`tests/ai-port.test.ts`'s contract suite runs `describeLlmPortContract` against both the
fake adapter and, through `tests/llm-replay.ts`'s replayed fixtures under
`tests/fixtures/llm/`, the Anthropic adapter — a bump that breaks either shows up there
first — and `tests/ai-anthropic.test.ts` covers the adapter's remaining edge cases the
same way, some against those same fixtures and the rest against a synthetic `fetch`. So
an `@anthropic-ai/sdk` bump is verified offline like any other, and re-recording a
fixture is never something a bump does on its way through — recording is a deliberate
local run under `LLM_RECORD=1` with a real credential, and it costs money.
`integrating-llm` owns that procedure.

Two checks run only on the PR. The `Dependency review` workflow fails on a new advisory
or a denied license, and the weekly production audit above is now a gate that can
actually fail: with runtime `dependencies` no longer empty, `pnpm audit --prod` is no
longer the no-op it was, so a red one is a finding about a package this application
ships, not noise.

## Range vs. pin, and how a change lands

- A runtime dependency declares a SemVer **range**, never an exact pin — a range plus
  `pnpm-lock.yaml` reproduces the install, and a pin only removes the fallback that
  makes the cooldown below survivable.
- Add or bump through `pnpm add`, never by hand-writing a version into `package.json`. A
  hand-typed recent version can be younger than the cooldown below, and a pin has no
  older version to fall back to, so the install fails outright rather than resolving to
  something older.
- A dependency change and its `pnpm-lock.yaml` update belong in the same commit. The
  lockfile is generated by `pnpm install`, never hand-edited: a hand-written entry
  states an integrity hash and a resolved graph nobody verified against the registry,
  and nothing downstream can tell that apart from a real resolution. Regenerate instead,
  with `pnpm install --lockfile-only` when you want the lockfile without the install.
- Dev dependencies are kept current by bot PRs plus the lockfile, not by hand.
  **REQUIRED:** `merge-dependabot` to land one.

## The release-age cooldown

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets a `minimumReleaseAge` cooldown: a version published too
recently will not resolve, for any install. Treat this as behavior to design around, not
an obstacle to route past.

- A `^`/`~` range silently resolves to an older, already-cooled version instead of the
  newest matching one — this is expected, not a bug.
- An exact pin on a version younger than the cooldown fails the install outright, since
  there is no older matching version for a pin to fall back to.
- Before adding or bumping a dependency, check how long its target version has actually
  been published; do not assume `latest` will resolve.

### Exception process

For an urgent security fix younger than the cooldown, a human may approve an exact
`package@version` entry in `minimumReleaseAgeExclude`. The same PR must:

- cite the advisory,
- explain why waiting is riskier than skipping the cooldown,
- include the regenerated lockfile, and
- state when the exception will be removed.

Never add a wildcard entry or a package-only (unversioned) exclusion — the exception is
scoped to one exact version, not to the package forever.

## Supply-chain settings, as consequences

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` holds the values; this is what each one means when it fires. Read
the file for the current values rather than trusting a number copied here.

- `strictDepBuilds` plus `allowBuilds`: an install-time lifecycle script from a
  dependency nobody has ruled on fails the install **on purpose** — that is the intended
  outcome, not a bug to route around. A Next.js dependency tree reaches several packages
  that want to run one, so this is a case-by-case review now rather than a single
  standing exception. Three questions settle an entry: what the script actually does
  (download a binary, compile native code, probe for a prebuilt one); whether anything
  this repository runs needs its result, or it belongs to a feature never turned on; and
  whether the package already ships a prebuilt platform binary as an optional
  dependency, making the script a fallback rather than the only path. `false` is as much
  a decision as `true` — it records that the script was reviewed and refused, so the
  next install failure is not answered with a reflexive `true`. Read the file's comments
  for the ruling each entry carries; adding a `true` one carries the same review weight
  as adding a new dependency.
- `strictPeerDependencies`: a peer range declared by an installed dependency and left
  unmet or conflicting is a hard install failure, not a warning. This is what makes the
  TypeScript ceiling below an enforced constraint instead of an advisory one. The only
  sanctioned way past it is a `peerDependencyRules.allowedVersions` entry naming one
  `parent>child` edge, and adding one asserts the package really does work against the
  version it did not declare — it is not a way to quiet an inconvenient failure.
  `overrides` is the same shape of exception for a resolved version, with the same
  burden: prefer naming the single `parent>child` edge, say why, and say what would let
  it be dropped. A package-wide override is the exception to that, and needs its own
  reason in the comment — that several independent edges reach the bad version, so an
  edge list would be incomplete the moment a new transitive dependency reopens it.
- `minimumReleaseAgeStrict` and `minimumReleaseAgeIgnoreMissingTime` close two specific
  bypasses of the cooldown above: an already-lockfiled version skipping the check, and
  registry metadata with no publish time being treated as old enough, respectively.
- `trustPolicy`, `trustLockfile`, and `blockExoticSubdeps` are independent supply-chain
  protections, not part of the cooldown: they reject a provenance/trusted-publisher
  regression, refuse to trust the trust metadata recorded in a contributor's lockfile,
  and refuse transitive dependencies fetched from git or arbitrary tarball URLs,
  respectively.
- `verifyDepsBeforeRun: error`: a `pnpm run` whose `node_modules` no longer matches the
  lockfile fails instead of letting a gate pass against stale dependencies. The fix is
  `pnpm install`, never a weaker value.
- `pmOnFail: download`: a local pnpm that does not satisfy `devEngines.packageManager`
  makes the install fetch the pinned one rather than fail. It is the only convenience
  here rather than a gate — it changes which pnpm resolves the lockfile, never what the
  policy above admits.

When one of these fires, find out why the install is actually failing; AGENTS.md holds
the prohibition on relaxing it.

## The one dependency outside pnpm's graph

`.mcp.json` runs `next-devtools-mcp` through `pnpm dlx`, straight from the npm registry,
with no `package.json` entry and no `pnpm-lock.yaml` line. Every protection above is a
`pnpm`-install-time mechanism, so none of it reaches this file: no lockfile pins the
resolved version, `minimumReleaseAge` never sees a `dlx` fetch, and `pnpm audit` never
walks a graph this file is not part of. Left unpinned (`next-devtools-mcp@latest`), the
same commit runs a different tool depending on when it happens to be fetched — no
lockfile, no cooldown, no review record, for a server that runs inside real development
sessions.

The command is `pnpm dlx`, never `npx` — that choice is load-bearing, not stylistic.
`npx` is npm's own runner, so it evaluates this repository's `package.json`
`devEngines.packageManager` (`pnpm@…`) before doing anything else; npm sees itself as
the running manager and aborts with `EBADDEVENGINES`. An MCP client always launches the
server with the project root as its cwd, so `npx` fails from every real launch, not just
occasionally. `pnpm dlx` never evaluates that check. Do not "simplify" this back to
`npx` — the failure it reintroduces reports `devEngines`, not `.mcp.json`, so it reads
as unrelated to this line and is easy to chase in the wrong file.

The fix is a manual substitute for what the lockfile does automatically elsewhere:

- Pin an exact version in the `args` array (`next-devtools-mcp@<version>`) — never
  `@latest` and never a `^`/`~` range. A range here has no lockfile to freeze its
  resolution, so it would still float to whatever is newest each time `pnpm dlx` runs;
  only an exact string is reproducible outside pnpm's graph.
- Resolve the version by hand with `npm view next-devtools-mcp version`, and check how
  recently it was published with `npm view next-devtools-mcp time --json` before
  adopting it — the cooldown above exists for exactly this reason (a freshly published
  version installed unreviewed), and nothing enforces it here, so apply it by eye:
  prefer a version that has been out for at least the `minimumReleaseAge` window over
  the newest one.
- Verify the pinned version actually starts **from the repository root**, not from a
  temp directory or any other cwd: run it there and send it an `initialize` request over
  stdio (or otherwise confirm the MCP client connects to it) — a crash or a malformed
  response is the whole of what "starts" means for a version with no test suite of its
  own here. Verifying from anywhere else can pass while the pin is broken for every real
  MCP client, which always launches from the project root — that gap is exactly how the
  `npx` form above shipped broken and unnoticed.
- Bumping is a manual PR by whoever notices the pin is stale or hits a bug fixed
  upstream — there is no bot PR for this one, unlike every dependency `package.json`
  declares. The PR that bumps it repeats the two steps above: resolve and age-check the
  new version, then verify it starts, from the repository root.

## TypeScript version ceiling

`typescript` is held below the version `typescript-eslint` caps its peer support at.
That package is now the only thing setting this ceiling, and it caps at a **minor**, not
just below the next major, so read the real range instead of assuming:

```bash
node -p "require('typescript-eslint/package.json').peerDependencies.typescript"
```

Compare it to `package.json`'s `devDependencies` range. With `strictPeerDependencies`
on, a bump past the ceiling fails the install rather than merely warning, so
`.github/dependabot.yml` ignores `typescript` minors as well as majors — an ignore
scoped to majors alone would still let the next minor through, and that is the one the
range actually caps at. Patches inside the current minor arrive as PRs as usual.

Do not "upgrade typescript to latest." Raising this ceiling is a coordinated upgrade —
`typescript-eslint` has to raise its own peer range first — not a routine bump.

## Handoff

**REQUIRED:** `merge-dependabot` for landing an already-open bot PR against these rules.
