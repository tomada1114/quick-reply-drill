  Covers working inside the Next.js App Router tree: adding a page or a layout under
  src/app/, deciding which file carries a "use client" directive, keeping
  src/app/api/<name>/route.ts a one-line re-export of a Web-standard handler wired in
  src/server/composition.ts, what belongs in src/proxy.ts, and reading configuration
  through src/server/env.ts. Use when adding or changing a route, page, layout or Route
  Handler, editing the proxy matcher, adding an environment variable or a NEXT_PUBLIC_

# Building App Routes

**Owns:** what goes where when a request is served — the Server/Client boundary inside
`src/app/`, the shape of a Route Handler and the handler behind it, `src/proxy.ts`, and
how configuration reaches any of them. **Does not own:** the `LlmPort` contract and the
adapter behind it (`integrating-llm`); message catalogs and the locale routing they
configure (`localizing-ui`); how a test case is written (`writing-tests`) and which
vitest project it joins (`placing-tests`); TypeScript idiom inside a module
(`writing-typescript`).

The zones, the direction imports run in, and what each zone publishes are AGENTS.md's
Architecture section; their literal patterns and budgets are `eslint.config.mjs`'s
`boundaries/*`, `public-api/explicit-surface` and `src/size-budget` blocks, asserted
again from the module graph by `tests/boundaries.test.ts`. Read those for the rules.
This skill is the procedure for working inside them.

## The two paths a request takes

A page request passes `src/proxy.ts` (locale detection), then `src/app/layout.tsx`,
`src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`, and the page. A JSON request goes to
`src/app/api/<name>/route.ts`, which re-exports a handler that
`src/server/composition.ts` built. Deciding where new code goes is mostly deciding which
of those files is the smallest one that can hold it — and, for anything with logic, the
answer is almost never a file under `src/app/`.

## The Server / Client boundary

Every file under `src/app/` is a Server Component until one says `"use client"`. This
template ships no such file: `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx` calls `useLocale` and
`useTranslations` and still runs on the server, because `next-intl` publishes a
`react-server` export condition and those hooks resolve to a server implementation
there. A hook is therefore not evidence that a file is a Client Component — the
directive is, and nothing else is.

- Add `"use client"` to the smallest file that actually needs the client: the one owning
  state, an effect, a browser API, or a DOM event handler. Pass it data as props from
  the server file above it.
- Never put the directive on a layout to make a child work. It marks the whole subtree,
  moves it into the client bundle, and the next reader has no way to see which
  descendant needed it.
- Nothing under `src/server/` belongs in a client file. `src/server/env.ts` and
  `src/server/composition.ts` import `server-only`, so those two fail the build instead
  of inlining a secret into a bundle — but only `pnpm build` sees it, and a handler
  module carries no such marker, so there the rule holds by discipline.

An **asynchronous** Server Component is not unit-tested here. `LocaleLayout` in
`src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` awaits its `params`; Testing Library renders on the client
renderer, which has nothing to resolve that promise with, so a test of it would assert
against a render production never performs. `vitest.config.ts`'s `component` project
covers the synchronous case instead — `tests/home-page.test.tsx` renders `HomePage`
under jsdom and supplies the `NextIntlClientProvider` context a real Server Component
tree would have provided. Everything asynchronous is checked by `pnpm build` and by
opening the page.

### Adding a page

The segment goes under `src/app/[locale]/`, not beside it: every page path carries a
locale prefix, so a route added outside that segment is one the proxy prefixes and the
tree then fails to match. Link to it with `Link` from `src/i18n/navigation.ts` and an
unprefixed pathname — `next/link` produces a URL with no locale, which costs a proxy
redirect round trip and drops the locale the reader was on. Then run `pnpm build` and
open the page. **BACKGROUND:** `localizing-ui` for the catalog the page reads its
strings from.

## A Route Handler is one re-export line

`src/app/api/ask/route.ts` is a single line re-exporting `askHandler` as `POST`. Copy
that shape for a new endpoint rather than inventing another:

1. Write the logic in `src/server/handlers/<name>.ts` as a
   `create<Name>Handler(dependencies)` factory returning
   `(request: Request) => Promise<Response>`, importing nothing from `next`.
2. Wire it once in `src/server/composition.ts` — the one file that chooses concrete
   dependencies — and export the built handler from there.
3. Re-export it from `src/app/api/<name>/route.ts` under the HTTP verb's name.

Two things make this worth the extra file. The handler is Web-standard, so a test drives
it with a plain `new Request(...)` and no framework, as `tests/server-handler.test.ts`
does. And `src/app/**` carries no coverage floor at all — `vitest.config.ts` thresholds
`src/{core,ai,server}/**` and deliberately leaves the App Router tree out — so logic
parked in a route file is logic no floor measures.

Keep the handler's signature `Request`-only. Next.js passes a dynamic segment's params
as a second argument to the route export, and taking it there is what turns the route
file back into code with untested branches; prefer the request body or the query string,
read from `new URL(request.url)`. If a segment param is genuinely the right shape, the
adaptation line in `route.ts` is the only logic that file may hold, and the parameter
still arrives at the handler as a plain argument.

The response contract is the status, the `error.code` vocabulary, and nothing from a
provider's own error text — a provider message can carry request content back to the
caller. `src/server/handlers/ask.ts` maps codes to statuses through a `satisfies` table
so an added code fails to compile rather than falling through to a default.
**BACKGROUND:** `designing-errors` for the code vocabulary itself.

### Who may call it, and how often

An endpoint under `src/app/api/` has nothing in front of it. `src/proxy.ts`'s matcher
excludes `api` outright, so no middleware runs; whatever the handler does not check, is
not checked. Two consequences, and they are answered differently.

**Authentication is a startup rule, not a per-request decision, and the adapter is what
triggers it.** `src/server/composition.ts` declares whether the adapter it wires bills a
provider (`ADAPTER_BILLS_A_PROVIDER`) and passes that to `readServerEnv` as
`requiresAccessKey`; `src/server/env.ts` then refuses an environment with no
`API_ACCESS_KEY`, so a deployment that pays for its answers cannot boot with the
endpoint open — `readServerEnv` throws and the server stops as it starts.
`src/server/composition.ts` passes the value down and `src/server/handlers/ask.ts`
compares it, in constant time and with the scheme matched case-insensitively (RFC 9110
§11.1), against the caller's `Authorization: Bearer` credential **before** the body is
read and before the port is reached; a mismatch is `401 ERR_UNAUTHORIZED` with a
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` challenge and a fixed sentence.

Key any gate of this kind off what the composition root wires, never off whether a
credential is present in `process.env`. The two are not the same question: a machine
exports `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for all sorts of reasons — recording the LLM fixtures under
`LLM_RECORD=1` is one — while this application still answers from the fake adapter and
bills no one, and a presence-based gate would refuse to start, build, or load a test
suite there for nothing. A second provider changes one field of that one declaration and
nothing else.

The zero-credential quick start is untouched by all of this: with the fake adapter
wired, nothing is required and the endpoint answers anyone, which is the promise
`pnpm dev` makes.

**This template ships no rate limit and no concurrency limit, and that is deliberate.**
A paid-adapter deployment must enforce its caller-throughput policy in an edge or
gateway layer before `POST /api/ask` reaches the app. That enforcement point must be
shared across instances; its exact store, algorithm, caller key, quota, window, and
concurrency policy belong to the deployment rather than this template. `src/proxy.ts` is
not the limiter because its matcher excludes `api` paths, so it does not run there. A
consuming application may add a handler-local limiter for defense in depth, but that is
not the deployment-wide safeguard and is not part of this issue.

**What the endpoint does bound is the size of one request.** `src/server/http.ts` reads
a JSON body through a wrapper that abandons it once it crosses `MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES`,
rather than trusting `Content-Length` — a header that is absent under chunked transfer
encoding and is otherwise whatever the client says it is, so only what is actually read
bounds anything. The request schema bounds the `prompt` at both ends after trimming it,
which is what bounds the input tokens billed for a call. Read a new endpoint's body
through the same helper instead of calling `request.json()`, and keep both refusals
ahead of the port: a request rejected after the model has answered has already been paid
for.

The endpoint all of this is illustrated with is the AI layer's only caller, so removing
that layer deletes `src/app/api/` and `src/server/composition.ts` outright. The pattern
above outlives them — the first endpoint of your own restores the composition root — but
until one exists, this section names files that are gone. **BACKGROUND:**
`starting-an-app`, which owns the removal and lists this skill among the files it edits.

## `src/proxy.ts`

Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`. In this repository that file is
`src/proxy.ts`, **not** the repository root, because the App Router tree lives under
`src/` and Next.js looks for the proxy beside it.

This is the trap this section exists for: at the repository root the file is simply
never loaded, and `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` all stay
green while every unprefixed path 404s. The one check that sees it is
`pnpm run test:smoke`, which serves the build with `next start` and asks it for `/` —
and it runs after `pnpm build`, not from `pnpm test`, so a green `pnpm check:quick`
still proves nothing here. A `/` that 404s under `pnpm dev` while the gate is green is
this, until proven otherwise.

- What belongs in it: a cheap decision made on the way to a route, for every matching
  request. Locale detection is the one it ships.
- What does not: data fetching, a database or model call, anything reading a secret, and
  anything slow. It runs ahead of every matching request and its cost is paid on all of
  them.
- `config.matcher` and the `src/app/[locale]/` segment have to agree — a path the proxy
  skips never acquires a locale prefix and then 404s against the segment. Both halves
  are asserted by `tests/proxy.test.ts`; run it whenever you touch either.
- The file is loaded by exact path through its default export, which is why
  `eslint.config.mjs` names it beside `src/app/**` and `src/i18n/request.ts` as an
  exemption to the default-export ban. That exemption list is for framework-owned entry
  points; a module of your own does not join it.

## Configuration

`src/server/env.ts` is the only module under `src/` that reads `process.env`. Everything
else — a page, a component, a handler, the proxy — receives what it needs as an
argument, wired in `src/server/composition.ts`. That is what makes "where does this
secret enter the process" a question answered by opening one file.

- Adding a variable means adding it to the schema in `src/server/env.ts` _and_ to
  `.env.example` with an empty value. `tests/server-env.test.ts` asserts that the two
  agree; it is the check to run first.
- A blank value reads as absent on purpose, so copying `.env.example` to `.env` is not a
  configuration error. Decide deliberately whether a new name is optional or required —
  a required one stops the process at startup, since `readServerEnv` throws rather than
  returning a `Result`: a malformed environment is a deployment mistake no caller can
  recover from.
- Never open a real `.env` to find out what exists. `src/server/env.ts` is the list of
  names and `.env.example` ships every one of them; AGENTS.md holds the prohibition.

### `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

Next.js inlines any variable whose name starts with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` into the client
bundle at build time. It is not a scope, an access rule, or a convenience for reaching a
value from a component — it is publication. Consequences worth deciding on before typing
the prefix:

- Never prefix a credential, a token, or anything whose disclosure matters. There is no
  later step that redacts it.
- The value is frozen into the build. Changing it needs a rebuild and a redeploy, and
  every deploy that shipped the old value still carries it.
- Anything genuinely public can equally be a constant in `src/core/` or a prop passed
  down from a Server Component — both of which a reviewer can see in the diff, which a
  variable read out of the environment at build time is not.

This repository declares no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` name today. Adding the first one is a
decision to state in the PR, not a detail.

## What each check actually covers

AGENTS.md's "Validating a change" table names the narrowest check per file; the part
worth knowing while working here is what those checks cannot see.

- `pnpm test` never renders the App Router tree and never starts a server. It covers the
  handler, the proxy's exported matcher and function, and synchronous components.
- `pnpm typecheck` does not resolve `"use client"`, the `server-only` marker, or the
  export shape a page or route file must have.
- `pnpm build` is the only check that does, so run it after touching anything under
  `src/app/` — and open the page, which is still the only way to learn that a request
  reached it at all.
