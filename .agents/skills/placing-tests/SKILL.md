  Decides where a new test file goes — always under tests/, never beside the module it
  covers — which of vitest.config.ts's four projects it joins (unit, component under
  jsdom for a .test.tsx, the explicit automation list, or smoke for the one suite that
  serves a build), and which coverage.thresholds floor governs it. Use when adding a
  .test.ts or .test.tsx file, when a test needs a DOM, spawns a subprocess or a server,
  when choosing between `pnpm exec vitest run` and `pnpm test:coverage`, or when a
  coverage run drops below a floor.

# Placing Tests

**Owns:** where a new test file goes, which vitest project it joins, and the coverage
floors that govern it. **Does not own:** how the test itself is written, its assertion
style, and its fixtures (`writing-tests`); compile-time assertions with `expectTypeOf`
(`type-testing`); what a gate file may contain at all (`changing-gates`).

## Location: `tests/`, never beside the source

Every test file lives at `tests/<subject>.test.ts` or `tests/<subject>.test.tsx`, named
after the seam it covers rather than after a file path — `tests/home-page.test.tsx` for
the page component, `tests/proxy.test.ts` for the locale proxy, `tests/result.test.ts`
for the `Result` vocabulary. Never co-locate a test next to the module it covers.

This is settled, and it is deliberately against the App Router convention of keeping a
test beside its component. Four mechanical reasons, each of which would have to be
undone to move a test into `src/`:

- `coverage.include` in `vitest.config.ts` is `src/**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.tsx` and
  `scripts/**/*.mjs`. A test file under `src/` would count itself as covered source and
  quietly lift every floor it sits under — the one direction a coverage number must
  never move by accident.
- The three vitest projects select on `tests/**` globs plus the file extension, and the
  automation project is an explicit list of `tests/…` paths. A co-located test joins no
  project until every one of those globs is widened.
- `eslint.config.mjs` scopes rules by tree: the `tests/vitest-rules` and
  `tests/relaxations` blocks match `tests/**`, while `src/size-budget`'s 200-line cap
  and the Next.js rule set match `src/**`. A test under `src/` would get the source
  rules and none of the test ones.
- `next build` compiles the `src/` tree. A test file there is build input.

`tests/fixtures/` is reserved for data under test, not test modules. Nothing under it is
linted, formatted, type-checked, spell-checked, or collected as a test —
`eslint.config.mjs`, `.prettierignore`, `tsconfig.json`, `typos.toml` and
`vitest.config.ts` all skip it, and `tests/tooling-ignores.test.ts` holds the five
together. That is what makes the tree usable for a fixture that is _meant_ to be
malformed or to fail, or for a whole project belonging to another toolchain, driven from
an `automation` test as a child process.

## Choosing a project

`vitest.config.ts` splits `test.projects` four ways. Placement follows from what the
file actually touches and which environment it needs — never from its name or its
subject:

- **`unit`** — `tests/**/*.test.ts`, the default. The test imports only `src/**` (plus,
  as a deliberate exception, the pure-function modules under `scripts/lib/`) and touches
  no filesystem, subprocess, or git. Node environment, 5-second budget.
- **`component`** — `tests/**/*.test.tsx`, selected by the extension alone. This is the
  only project running under jsdom, and the only one loading `tests/dom-setup.ts`, which
  registers the DOM matchers and Testing Library's `cleanup`. A test that renders a
  component under jsdom goes here by being written as `.tsx`; there is no list to join.
  `tests/home-page.test.tsx`, the only one today, renders a synchronous Server Component
  — this template ships no Client Component. It has no I/O either, so it keeps the same
  short budget as `unit`.
- **`automation`** — the explicit `automationTests` list at the top of
  `vitest.config.ts`, with a 120-second budget. Everything that shells out, reads or
  writes a temp directory, spawns `git`/`node`, or walks whole trees on disk asserting
  against files rather than against imported code.
- **`smoke`** — the `smokeTests` list beside it, one file today. A test joins it only
  when it cannot run without `pnpm build`'s output on disk: it starts the built
  application with `next start` and asserts over `fetch`. That is what makes it a
  project of its own rather than another automation entry — the default run
  (`pnpm test`, `pnpm test:coverage`, and ci.yml's `test` job) filters it out with
  `--project='!smoke'`, because there is no build there to serve and a suite that built
  one for itself would pay for a second build in every workflow. `pnpm run test:smoke`
  is what runs it, from `check:source` and from ci.yml's `static` job, both times
  straight after `Build`. A test here checks the build it was handed rather than making
  one: `tests/server-smoke.test.ts` fails with an instruction when `.next/BUILD_ID` is
  missing, and again when it is older than `src/`, `messages/` or `next.config.ts`,
  because a run against last commit's build passes every assertion while proving nothing
  about the change. Adding a file here is a claim that no in-process test could have
  asserted the same thing; prefer `automation` whenever one could.

The two directions fail differently, which is why `automation` is a list rather than a
glob. Forgetting to register a test that does I/O leaves it in `unit`, where the short
budget makes it time out loudly rather than pass on a budget nobody chose. Listing a
pure test in `automationTests` is the quiet mistake: it still passes, just on a budget
far longer than it needs. So a new test starts in `unit` (or in `component`, by its
extension) and joins `automationTests` only when its I/O is deliberately reviewed.

**Why the timeouts differ:** a `unit` or `component` test has no I/O, so if it hangs the
only possible cause is an infinite loop or an unresolved promise, and a short timeout
surfaces that in seconds. An `automation` test legitimately needs the long budget for a
real subprocess or temp-directory operation — giving it the short one would make correct
tests flaky.

Coverage is collected once for the whole run, never per project, so the split above
changes nothing about which floor applies.

## Coverage floors

`coverage.include` lists source and automation files on purpose: a file with no test
still counts toward the denominator at 0% instead of vanishing from it. A new file is
covered from the moment it exists — write its test in the same PR, not as follow-up.

**There is no top-level floor, and that is a decision rather than an omission.** The v8
provider checks a top-level threshold against the coverage of _all_ included files
combined, so one number over `src/` and `scripts/` together would let a well-tested zone
subsidize an untested file in the other. Independent per-glob threshold sets are what
stop that: each is judged only against its own coverage, and each answers a different
question.

- **The `src/` zones** named in `coverage.thresholds` carry the baseline floor for this
  repository's own logic. That glob is deliberately narrower than `coverage.include`:
  `src/app/**` and `src/components/**` carry **no floor at all**. They are framework
  entry points and rendered markup, exercised by a component render or a build rather
  than by a unit test, and a floor they cannot meet would only teach the next author to
  move the number. They stay inside `coverage.include`, so an untested file there still
  reports as a percentage — it simply has no floor to trip. That distinction is the
  whole point: a narrower _threshold_ glob keeps the number visible, while a
  `coverage.exclude` entry would hide it, which is what AGENTS.md's "never weaken a
  gate" forbids by name. Widening or narrowing the threshold glob is a decision to argue
  for in a PR.
- **`scripts/**`** was never measured before it was added to `coverage.include`, so its
  floor is the last measured coverage rounded down to a clean value, not a guessed
  target — it has been raised as coverage grew (see the dated comments in
  `vitest.config.ts`). Raise it again as real coverage grows; never invent a number
  ahead of the measurement.
- **`scripts/lib/guard/**`** — the credential and path detection rule engine, the most
  security-critical code in the repository — carries its own higher floor, so it cannot
  regress just because it is dragged along by whatever number the broader `scripts/**`
  tree happens to sit at. It counts toward that aggregate too, on top of its own floor.
  The two trees' branch floors are set independently and are raised as each tree's own
  measured branch coverage grows, so do not assume one bounds the other.

See `vitest.config.ts`'s `coverage.thresholds` for the current numbers; this skill
deliberately does not repeat them, since a copied number goes stale the moment the
config changes.

**Coverage stops at the process boundary.** The v8 provider instruments the Vitest
workers and nothing else, so a `src/` module that only ever executes inside a process
the test spawns reports 0% however thoroughly the integration test exercises it — and 0%
against a floor fails the run. Design for it rather than discovering it: keep the part
that runs in the child thin and put the logic behind it in a module the test can also
call in-process.

- **Branch coverage is the one that matters.** Cover both sides of a conditional rather
  than adding a trivial test whose only effect is moving a line/statement percentage.
- **A floor is never lowered, and no file is added to `coverage.exclude` to move a
  number** — AGENTS.md's "Security and human approval" holds that prohibition for every
  agent, including one whose task is only "make CI green." What this skill owns is which
  floor applies and why.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run tests/<name>.test.ts   # one file, fast iteration
pnpm test:coverage                          # full suite with floors enforced
pnpm build && pnpm run test:smoke           # the smoke project, which needs the build
```

If `pnpm test:coverage` fails on a floor, add real coverage for the uncovered branch —
do not adjust the threshold or the include list.
