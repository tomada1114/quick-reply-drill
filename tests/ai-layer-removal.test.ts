// Not every app built from this template wants a language model in it, so the
// AI layer has to come out in one piece: delete `src/ai/`, the handlers that
// depend on it, the environment key, the skill that documents it and the
// matching `.env.example` lines, and the repository that remains must still
// build, lint, and test — with nothing left pointing at what was removed.
//
// `scripts/bootstrap.mjs` used to assert exactly this, through an
// `AI_LAYER_TARGETS` list and a dangling-reference scan over the tree it was
// about to generate. Issue #3 deleted that script, and the property went with
// it. The idea is worth keeping and the implementation is not — it was
// profile-driven and self-deleting — so it is rebuilt here as a test over the
// real tree.
//
// What makes the property checkable without actually deleting anything: the
// removal set is named, and everything that mentions it is named too. A file
// that starts referring to the AI layer without joining one of those two lists
// fails this suite, which is the moment the layer stops being removable.

 * path — `LlmErrorCode` in a sentence about unions, `outputLanguage` in one
 * about a seam — and a removal that greps only for paths edits the file it
 * found for one reason and leaves the sentence it did not.
 *
 * Each needle is as narrow as the name it has to catch. A bare `LLM_` would
 * also match the `LLM_API_KEY` sample line in `tests/guard-rules.test.ts` and
 * `tests/check-staged.test.ts`, where it stands for any secret-shaped
 * assignment and stays whether or not this application calls a model; the two

 * layer, and a needle matching a survivor that is not on the edited lists
 * fails this suite for a false reason.
 *
 * `/api/ask` belongs here rather than on `REMOVED_PATHS` because it names the
 * removed route by its URL, not its source path: `REMOVED_PATHS` carries
 * `src/app/api`, and `"src/app/api".includes(text)` never matches a sentence
 * or a test request that spells the route as `POST /api/ask` — the two
 * strings share no substring. A document names an endpoint by the address a
 * caller sends a request to at least as often as by the file that answers it,
 * so the URL needs a needle of its own the same way `outputLanguage` needs one
 * separate from `src/ai/port.ts`.

 * which would make the expected value agree with the thing under test.
 *
 * Only the authored `.agents/skills/` half is read; the `.claude/skills/`
 * entry beside it names the same skill. The *first* segment is the name, so an
 * entry written as a file or a subdirectory rather than as the skill directory
 * — `.agents/skills/foo/SKILL.md` — still yields `foo` rather than nothing.

 * credential, and `.env.example` is where its name is published.
 * `package.json` declares the vendor SDK, which is the AI layer's one runtime
 * dependency and leaves with it — a manifest entry, not an application module,
 * which is why it can join this half without weakening what it claims.
 * `tests/server-smoke.test.ts` asks the running application for every route it
 * publishes, `POST /api/ask` among them, so the removal deletes those cases
 * the same way it deletes the route; it is a test of the composed application,
 * not a module the layer is embedded in. `tests/proxy.test.ts` picked the same
 * route as its example of a nested API path the locale matcher leaves alone —
 * a case named `"a nested API route"` with `/api/ask` as the literal — and a
 * matcher test choosing a path that no longer exists needs a different
 * example, even though the matcher's own behaviour does not change. This
 * half is where the separability property lives: it is the one that has to stay
