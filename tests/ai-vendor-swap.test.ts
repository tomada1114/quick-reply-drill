// `tests/ai-layer-removal.test.ts` pins the rare path — taking the whole AI
// layer out in one piece. This file pins the common one: keeping `LlmPort` and
// swapping the vendor behind it. A project built from this template usually
// wants a language model; it does not necessarily want this one.
//
// The property is that a swap is a *bounded* edit, and the bound is stated in
// two halves that fail for different reasons:
//
//   - `SWAP_EDITS` is exhaustive and has to stay small. It is the whole cost of
//     a swap in code, and an entry joining it means the cost went up.
//   - `VENDOR_TREES` and `NOT_THE_MODEL_PROVIDER` are prefixes, not files. A
//     tree whose subject *is* the vendor grows a file whenever the adapter is
//     documented or tested better, and enumerating those files would be a list
//     edited on every unrelated commit — which is a gate that gets deleted
//     rather than obeyed. What they still forbid is the leak this file exists
//     for: a vendor name reaching a tree that has no business carrying one.

 * contain it and so does the adapter directory's own name — and a leak worth
 * catching is just as likely to arrive as a path in a config or a sentence in
