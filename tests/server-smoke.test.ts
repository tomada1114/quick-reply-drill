// The only suite that asks the application a question over HTTP. Every other
// test here drives one layer through its own surface — a handler with
// `new Request()`, a page under jsdom — so nothing else notices when the seams
// between them come apart: a Route Handler the App Router never mounts, a
// layout that renders under jsdom and throws in a real render. This starts the
// built application the way a deployment does — the production build, served by
// `next start` under `NODE_ENV=production` — and asserts only what a client
// outside the process can see.
//
// No browser and no E2E harness, deliberately: `next start` plus `fetch` needs
// neither, and issue #12's decision to take on neither still stands.

// The invariant every case below is written to keep: no smoke case ever
// reaches a model. The server is spawned with `OPENAI_API_KEY: ""`, so every
// model-backed endpoint answers `ERR_LLM_AUTH` before a socket is opened, and
// on top of that no case sends a schema-valid body to an endpoint that would
// otherwise pay for an answer. A case that would need a real key belongs in
// the issue's manual checklist, not here.
