// Remove build output without depending on a shell or an extra package.
// Only paths passed on the command line are removed, and only when they sit
// inside the repository. Containment is checked twice — once on the resolved
// string, and once more after symlinks on the way to the target have been
// followed — so neither a typo nor a directory symlink pointing out of the
// checkout reaches past the project. Two things that guarantee does not
// cover, stated rather than left to be discovered: a target whose own final
// component is a symlink is still accepted, because `rmSync` unlinks the link
// and never follows it, so what disappears is the link and not what it points
// at; and the check runs before the removal, so a symlink swapped in between
// the two would not be seen.
// Node globals are imported explicitly rather than declared as ESLint globals:
// one convention for every .mjs file here, and no extra dependency.

 * `realpathSync` fails on a path that is not there, and `clean` is routinely

 * for — so a plain `realpathSync` would refuse the ordinary case. This walks
 * up to the nearest ancestor that does resolve and rejoins the rest by name.
 * A component that genuinely does not exist (`ENOENT`) or that turned out
 * not to be a directory partway through resolving a longer path (`ENOTDIR`)
 * is one the filesystem has nothing behind, so rejoining it lexically cannot
 * hide a symlink: every component that exists is already canonical in the
 * result. Any other failure — most importantly `EACCES`/`EPERM` from an
 * ancestor directory the process cannot search — means the walk cannot tell
 * whether that component is a symlink or not, so it fails closed instead of
