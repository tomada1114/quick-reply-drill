// and differ on a single basename; the pre-commit staged-content check

// Lockfile hand-editing is not a path-shaped rule here: a re-generated
// lockfile (`pnpm install`) is normal to commit, and a git diff cannot tell
// that apart from a hand edit. Only a layer that sees the tool call that
// produced the change could tell them apart, and this repository does not
// enforce one — see AGENTS.md's "Enforcement layers".

 * Deliberately narrower than {@link checkRead}, on exactly one path. direnv's
 * bare `.envrc` is the shared half of its convention — `use flake`,
 * `source_env_if_exists .envrc.local` — and is routinely tracked, while the
 * values live in `.envrc.local` / `.envrc.private`, which this still refuses.
 * Refusing the shared script would fire on work someone meant to do, and the
 * flag that teaches — `--no-verify` — turns off the credential scan with it;
 * see AGENTS.md's "Enforcement layers". A bare `.envrc` is therefore judged on
 * its content, like any other tracked file, rather than on its name. The read
 * layer keeps refusing it: a `.envrc` in a checkout may hold values whether or
 * not it is the tracked one, and a needless refusal there costs an agent only
 * a file it did not have to open.
 *
 * This template still gitignores `.envrc`, so the carve-out changes nothing
 * here — the two layers are a default and a gate, and only the default is a
 * downstream project's to drop. A generated project that follows direnv's
 * convention deletes that `.gitignore` line and then needs this gate to let
 * the file through; leaving the gate refusing it would make that project
 * choose between an untracked shared script and `--no-verify`.
 *
 * @param {string} filePath - Path staged for commit.
 * @returns {string | null} Why the path is secret-shaped, or null when the path
 * alone does not refuse the commit. The reason text is the read layer's
 * phrasing; `scripts/check-staged.mjs` uses only its null-ness and composes its
 * own refusal sentence.
