// ci.yml's `test` job) has no build to serve, and a suite that quietly built
// one for itself would pay for a second build in every workflow. It refuses to
// run against a missing or stale build instead, so the build stays the
// caller's to do exactly once. `pnpm run test:smoke` is what runs it, from
// `check:source` and from ci.yml's `static` job immediately after `Build`; the
// two default scripts filter it out with `--project='!smoke'`. Naming the file

// test importing anything under `src/server/` would fail on the marker rather
// than on the behavior it asserts. Point the runner at the very file the RSC
// graph gets. Vite's own condition options do not reach it — the package is
