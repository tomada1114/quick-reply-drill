 * stated once, ahead of the adapters that consume the SDK. The Vercel AI SDK
 * core is included too: all model SDK imports are implementation details of an
 * adapter and must not leak into the other zones.
 *
 * The Vercel AI SDK's own core (`ai`) names no vendor, but it still belongs
 * behind the adapter boundary. Keeping it in this list makes that boundary
 * explicit and prevents an SDK call from bypassing `LlmPort`.
 *
 * `openai` and `ai` are the entries that have to be anchored by hand.
 * `no-restricted-imports` matches through the `ignore` package, where a pattern
 * carrying no slash matches that name at *any* depth — bare `openai` and `ai`
 * would therefore also catch `./openai`, `../core/openai/index`, and other
 * relative specifiers that reach a module of this repository's own and have
 * nothing to do with a language-model SDK. The leading `/` anchors each one to
 * the whole specifier, which only a bare package name can be. The scoped entries
 * need no such treatment: they already carry a slash.

/**
 * Each zone under `src/`, as every specifier that can reach into it.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A zone is reachable two ways. Relatively, leaving your own zone costs at
 * least one `../`, and the same module is `../ai/index` from one file and
 * `../../ai/index` from another. The globstar after the `../` absorbs the rest
 * whatever the importer's depth, so one pattern covers every caller; the bare
 * form is listed alongside the recursive one because a directory import
 * (`../ai`) has no trailing segment for a trailing globstar to match.
 *
 * The leading `../` is load-bearing, not decoration. An unanchored
 * `**\/server` would also match a package subpath such as `next/server` — the
 * anchored form cannot, because a bare specifier never starts with `..` or `.`.
 *
 * Each entry also carries a `./../**` twin of every `../**` pattern, because
 * `no-restricted-imports` matches the specifier text through the `ignore`
 * package rather than resolving it, and `ignore` treats a leading `./` as a
 * different string from a leading `../` — so `./../ai/errors` matches
 * neither the `../**\/ai/**` pattern nor the `!../**\/ai/index` exemption below
 * without its own `./../**` copy. A bare specifier still cannot start with
 * `./..`, so the twin is exactly as safe as the pattern it doubles.
 *
 * The other way is the `@/*` → `./src/*` alias `tsconfig.json` declares (issue
 * #13 added it, because shadcn/ui writes `@/components/...` imports into every
 * component it copies in). That spelling carries no `../` to anchor and needs
 * none: it is already absolute from `src/`, so `@/ai/**` names the zone from
 * any depth, and it is safe to match unanchored because no bare package name
 * can start with `@/` — a scoped package is `@scope/name`, and `/` is not a
 * legal scope. A zone left without its `@/` twin would be a boundary the alias
 * walks straight through, which is why every entry here carries both.
